# Data-Analysis--using-SQL
A project showcasing SQL scripts for data analysis tasks.
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a modified version with updated headings for your project:

# Project Motivation
I embarked on this project to explore data analysis using SQL and demonstrate my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. The European Soccer Database, with its extensive and detailed data on soccer, provided the perfect foundation to apply SQL techniques and gain practical experience in data manipulation, aggregation, and insightful analysis

# -Key SQL Concepts
Before diving into the analysis, it's essential to understand some core SQL concepts that will be frequently used throughout the project:
- Establishing Database Connection: Connecting to the database and exploring its structure.
- Countries Information: Extracting data about the countries represented in the dataset.
- Leagues and Countries: Retrieving data about soccer leagues and their associated countries.
- Teams Data: Analyzing the teams participating in various leagues.
- Match Insights: Gathering insights from historical match data.
- Basic Analytics: Conducting initial analysis to uncover trends and patterns

# Project Overview
The European Soccer Database is a comprehensive dataset containing over 25,000 matches, 10,000 players, and rich metadata sourced from the FIFA video game series. This database offers a wealth of information to perform detailed data analysis, such as player attributes, match results, and betting odds. By utilizing this dataset, I aim to showcase my SQL skills and perform insightful analysis that reveals trends and patterns in European soccer.

What's Included:
- Matches: Over 25,000 matches from 2008 to 2016 across 11 European countries.
- Players: Information about 10,000+ players, including detailed attributes.
- Leagues: Data about various European soccer leagues.
- Teams: Team rosters and squad data.
- Betting Odds: Betting odds data from multiple providers.
- Match Events: Detailed match event data such as goals, fouls, and possession.

# Project Workflow
This project is structured to help guide the analysis process step by step:
1. Database Connection & Exploration: Establishing a connection to the database and exploring the available tables and their relationships.
2. Countries Analysis: Retrieving and analyzing information about the countries in the dataset.
3. Leagues and Teams Overview: Examining the leagues and their countries, and investigating teams and their performance.
4. Match Data Analysis: Analyzing match outcomes and related events to draw meaningful insights.
5. Advanced SQL: Using subqueries, joins, and functions to perform advanced data manipulation and analysis.

# Getting Started with the Project
To replicate or build upon this analysis, follow these simple steps:
1.	Download the Dataset: Obtain FROM [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer/data) and set up a local SQL database to store the data.
2. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following Git command:
   FROM [GitHub] (https://github.com/vaishalii2/Data-Analysis--using-SQL)
3. Execute the SQL Scripts: Run the SQL scripts in the provided Jupyter Notebook or any preferred SQL environment to begin your analysis.
